# Step - 1 | CHOOSE YOUR PYTHON INTERPRETER

# When running a python script, you can choose your python interpreter
# i.e. the version of python that will run your code
# by pressing Ctrl + Shift + P on Windows/Linux
# or Cmd + Shift + P on Mac 
# then select "Python: Select Interpreter"
# and choose the conda environment of your choice,
# in our case --> dmlap

# Step - 2 | RUN THIS SCRIPT

# By the time you have selected your environment, you should be able to run this script 
# by either pressing the play button at the top right of the window
# or by openning the terminal (Ctrl + `) and typing:
# python python/01-intro-to-python/03_hello_world.py


# This line, starting with a '#' is a comment
# The line below is telling Python to print: Hello World!
print("Hello World!")
